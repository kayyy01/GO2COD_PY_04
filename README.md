# BMI Calculator

## Description
This Python script calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided height and weight. 
The BMI is then categorized into various classifications, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. 
This project demonstrates basic input handling, calculations, and conditional statements in Python.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

  """"""""
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   
   """""""

2. Open the script file (e.g., bmi_calc.py) in your preferred text editor or IDE.

3. Run the Python script:

""""""
   python bmi_calculator.py
   
""""""

4. Follow the prompts to input your height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).

## Code Explanation
- **Input Handling**: The script uses the input() function to collect user data for height and weight.
- **BMI Calculation**: BMI is calculated using the formula:
    BMI = weight(kg)/ (height)**2 (m)


- **Conditional Statements**: The script categorizes the BMI result into:
  - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
  - Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
  - Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
  - Obesity: BMI ≥ 30

## Usage
When you run the script, you will see prompts like the following:


- Enter your height in meters: 1.75
- Enter your weight in kilograms: 70
- Your BMI is: 22.86
- You are categorized as: Normal weight
